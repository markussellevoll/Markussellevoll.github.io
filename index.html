        <h2>What is Cognitive Science?</h2>
        <p>
			Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind and its processes, exploring how humans think, learn, and solve problems. 
			At its core, it combines insights from fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, and computer science to understand cognition.
			A key focus in cognitive science is the use of programming and logic to model mental processes. <br/><br/> For instance, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are tools often used to replicate or 
			simulate human reasoning and learning in computational systems. Logical frameworks, such as propositional and predicate logic, are essential for analyzing thought processes and building algorithms that mimic human decision-making.
			<br/> <br/>Beyond programming and logic, cognitive science also delves into language acquisition, perception, memory, and problem-solving. It examines how the brain processes information, how we learn languages, and how emotions influence decision-making.
			 Cognitive science also investigates the relationship between the physical brain and abstract thought, integrating neuroscience to study neural mechanisms.
			By bridging these domains, cognitive science not only helps us understand the nature of human cognition but also drives advancements in technology, 
			such as the development of smarter AI, user-friendly interfaces, and applications in education, healthcare, and beyond.</p>

        <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/langrenn2.jpg" alt="Cross-country skiing"></a>
        <p>Throughout my life, I've had a passion for cross-country skiing. I followed my passion and moved to
            Hovden, where I started at <a href="https://hovdenskigymnas.no">Hovden Skigymnas</a>. This experience made me
            a self-driven, independent athlete. I utilized my experience with cross-country skiing by becoming a coach at Oppegård IL.

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>As a cross-country skier, I learned invaluable lessons that extend far beyond the sport itself. 
			The discipline required for early morning training sessions, the resilience to push through physically and mentally demanding races, 
			and the importance of teamwork in a sport that often feels solitary have all profoundly shaped who I am today.
			<br/> <br/>Cross-country skiing taught me to embrace challenges and focus on steady progress.
			 It also emphasized the significance of community, as success often depended on the support of teammates, coaches, 
			 and those who shared the same passion. These values—resilience, discipline, and collaboration—continue to guide me in every aspect of life, 
			 from academics to professional and personal pursuits.

        <h2>More About Military Service</h2>
        <p>
            I had the privilege of serving in His Majesty The King’s Guard (HMKG) for 12 months. The first three months of my service were spent at Terningmoen, 
            where I underwent basic training and learned the skills necessary for serving in this prestigious unit. 
            It was a challenging but rewarding time that helped me build discipline and camaraderie with my fellow recruits.
            <br /><br />
            After completing the initial training period, I moved to Huseby, where I spent the remaining nine months of my service. 
            At Huseby, I took on the responsibilities that come with being a part of the King’s Guard. Whether it was ceremonial duties, standing guard,
            or contributing to the daily operations, 
            I felt a deep sense of pride in representing Norway and its traditions. My time in HMKG taught me valuable lessons about teamwork,
            resilience, and attention to detail—experiences I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
